## Active Context (clear after merging)

- Current Goal: <What are you working on right now?>
- Constraint: <Any temporary constraints or compatibility requirements?>
- Files in focus: <Key files being modified>
- Blocker: <What's blocking progress, if anything?>

## Ownership map

- UI / Frontend owner: <path/module>
- Backend / Server owner: <path/module>
- Data parsing / protocol owner: <path/module>
- Build/CI owner: <path/module>

## Current truth (high-signal)

- <Add invariants that are true right now>
- <Add key toggles/defaults that must not drift>
- <Add any critical lifecycle/timing rules>

## Open questions / TODO

- <What is unknown or risky?>

## Session notes

When you say "I'm done" or "Merge this", remember to:
1. Clear the Active Context section above
2. Add a journal entry if the work was significant
3. Create a lesson if you discovered a non-obvious pitfall
