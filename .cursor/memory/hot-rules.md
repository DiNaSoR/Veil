# Hot Rules (MUST READ)

Keep this file under ~20 lines. If it grows, move content into memo or lessons.

## Authority Order (highest to lowest)
1) Lessons override EVERYTHING (including active-context)
2) active-context.md overrides memo/journal (but NOT lessons)
3) memo.md is long-term project truth
4) journal is history

## Retrieval Rules
5) Do NOT scan raw journals. Use indexes/digests first.
6) Reuse existing patterns. Check memo.md ownership before creating new systems.
7) When done: clear active-context.md, add journal entry if significant.
