# Hot Rules (MUST READ)

Keep this file short. If it grows, move content into memo/lessons.

1) Do NOT break lessons. Lessons override everything.
2) Memo is current truth (ownership + invariants).
3) Do NOT scan raw journals by default. Use indexes/digests first.
4) Reuse existing patterns and owners. Do not create parallel systems.
5) After any feature/fix: update journal. If a new pitfall is discovered: add a lesson.
