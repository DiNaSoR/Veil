# Journal

Monthly file: `YYYY-MM.md`

Rules:
- Each date appears ONCE per file: `## YYYY-MM-DD`
- Put multiple entries under that header as bullets.
- Keep it high-signal: what changed, why, key files.
- Put long narratives in Docs/WorkLogs and link them.

Add entries via:
- `scripts/memory/add-journal-entry.ps1 -Tags "UI,Fix" -Title "..."`
